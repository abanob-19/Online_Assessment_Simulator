During my academic journey, I was privileged to develop an advanced online assessment simulator that leverages cutting-edge technologies. 🖥️✨
🔹 Introducing the "Online Assessment Simulator":
This state-of-the-art platform incorporates a wide range of advanced features built on the powerful MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It provides a comprehensive and interactive environment for students and educators to engage in assessments, revolutionizing the way we approach online education.
🌟 Key Features:
Random exam generation for diverse assessment experiences
Auto-grading functionality for the known answers to expedite the evaluation
Manual grading for subjective questions without revealing student’s identity
Support for various question types, including multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and text-based questions
Seamless integration of webcam functionality to ensure exam integrity
Dynamic calculation of equations based on generated variables
Efficient question bank management system for easy organization and reuse
User roles for instructors and students with distinct privileges.


By harnessing the power of modern technologies, the Online Assessment Simulator brings a new level of interactivity and efficiency to the assessment process. It empowers educators to design meaningful assessments, enables students to engage in realistic exam experiences, and offers a seamless grading process.
I am immensely proud of the results achieved and the potential impact this Online Assessment Simulator holds for the educational community.
